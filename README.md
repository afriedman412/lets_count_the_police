# Mapping America's Police Departments
In June of 2018, East Pittsburgh Police officer Michael Rosfeld shot 17 year old Antwan Rose Jr. in the back, killing him. Rose was one of several passengers fleeing a jitney which Police had stopped for being visually connected to a recent shooting. But Rose did not know the other passengers and had not committed any crime. In a surprising turn of events, after heavy protests from the community shut down major roads in Pittsburgh, Officer Rosfeld was arrested and charged with criminal homicide (although he was grainted bail and set free).

Officer Rosfeld's career in law enforcement up to this point was not exactly exemplary. Prior to joining East Pittsburgh PD (East Pittsburgh is a small borough outside the city, not a part of Pittsburgh proper), Rosfeld spent five years on the police force of the University of Pittsburgh. He left after a lawsuit alleged abuses in December of 2017. EPPD hired him a scant four months later.

A side note: In the press conference announcing Rosfeld's indictment, a reporter asked Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala about EPPD's policies regarding such situations. Zappala responded that, by all accounts, the department [has no policies about anything](https://twitter.com/meganguzaTrib/status/1011996036397780993).

Rosfeld's journey to East Pittsburgh via questionable departure from his last gig made me wonder if the sheer number of police departments in America could contribute to systematic abuse. (Similar questions about the balkanization of suburban St. Louis police came up in the aftermath of Ferguson as well.) So I decided to find a way to map America's police departments.

_This is a first draft._ The data is from [PoliceOne](http://www.policeone.com) and is entirely self-reported. It is incomplete, with some states missing entirely. But hopefully further interations will yield better data and, eventually, useful analysis.
